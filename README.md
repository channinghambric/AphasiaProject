This is the data and code repository for the paper "Lexical Search and Retrieval in Aphasia: A Computational Analysis of Semantic Fluency." 

All fluency data and de-identified battery csvs can be found in the /excel_data subfolder. Within the forager folder, raw fluency lists can be found in the /data/fluency_lists. Lexical data (including word frequencies, word embeddings, semantic matrices, and phonological matrices) used for model calculations can be found in /data/lexical_data. Model outputs can be found in the /output subfolders. Analysis scripts (R notebooks) can be found in the /analysis subfolder.
